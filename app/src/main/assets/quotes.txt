Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay.
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
The past cannot be changed. The future is yet in your power.
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. 
Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. 
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Well done is better than well said.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Your talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God.
Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.
Quality is not an act, it is a habit.
